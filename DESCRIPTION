Description: 'spdlog' is a mature and widely-used C++ library for logging with many
 desirable features that was written by Gabi Melman, and released under a MIT license.
 'Spdlog' itself includes the 'fmt' library by Victor Zverovich which is also released
 under a MIT license. This package bundles these header files for easy use by R packages
 via a simple 'LinkingTo:' inclusion. Note that you may not want to include 'spdlog' in a
 (release-ready) package as running checks it will reveal use of 'stdout' and 'stderr'.
